# Asteroids

---

## 📌 Overview

This repository contains a 3D game developed using the [bevy](https://bevy.org/) engine in Rust.

The game is inspired by the classic "Asteroids" arcade game, where players navigate a spaceship through an asteroid field, avoiding collisions and destroying asteroids to score points.
The main objective of this project is to bring this experience into a 3D environment.

This project was made as part of the curriculum for the course "Design of a Game Software" at [Chung-Ang University](https://www.cau.ac.kr/).
